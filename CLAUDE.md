This is a website build with Slipstream, a SwiftUI-like Swift framework for building websites that are compatible with TailwindCSS (v3, specifically).

The site generator is located in the ScoutWeb directory, and can be ran from within that directory like so: `swift run ScoutWeb`

Any time the site generator's Swift sources change, the site needs to be rebuilt.
